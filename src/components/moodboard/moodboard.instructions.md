# Feature: Moodboard

## What

Use a list of user provided concepts and their descriptions to generate a set of images that represent the Parti of a design.

## How

Input: Parti (string), list of concepts ({name: string, description: string}[]), existing image descriptions (string[])
Intermediate output: list of artifacts ({name: string, description: string}[])
Final output: list of images (urls)

Artifact name is for human to quickly identify what it is. It should be very short, one word, or a short phrase only.

Artifact description is a detailed text description for AI to generate images from. It should be one sentence long, detailed description including subject, scene, style.

Artifact generation uses a similar process to concept generation, but with a system prompt that instructs the LLM to generate artifacts commonly seen in a moodboard. The want the image to be diverse and represent multi-sensory aspects of the Parti.

We generate 5 initially, and 3 incrementally

Artifact generation is single thread but we will receive incremental outputs (as we do in concept generation).

Text-to-image generation happens automatically within the generative-image web component. Each artifact's description is passed as the prompt to the component, which handles the image generation process internally using the Together.ai API.

## User control

A button to Generate Artifacts (image descriptions + images)
A text field with an "Add Artifact" button for manual artifact entry. The text field also functions as a paste target for images.
For each artifact, user can see the text description as well as the image.
For each artifact, user can Accept or Reject it, similar to the concept generation workflow

## UI

Display artifacts as cards in a grid. The cards are like Polaroids with the generative-image component on top and the description below. The generative-image component automatically handles loading states, error states, and displays a placeholder while generating.

Rejected artifacts only show the title with a restore button.

## Manual Artifact Addition

Users can manually add artifacts through a text input field with an "Add Artifact" button. This supports two modes:

1. **Text input**: User types an artifact description directly into the text field. When "Add Artifact" is clicked, the text is used as the artifact description for image generation.

2. **Image paste**: The text field also functions as a paste target. When user pastes an image (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V), the pasted image is directly added as an artifact without going through text-to-image generation. The system should extract or generate a description for the pasted image.

The text field should have placeholder text indicating both functions: "Type artifact description or paste image here..."
