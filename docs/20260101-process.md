## Conceptualize

Start with high level design goal: "Playfulness"

AI generates related concepts:

```txt
Whimsy: Lighthearted spontaneity that invites delight and surprise.
Frolic: Playful, carefree activity marked by energetic joy and a sense of freedom.
Gamefulness: A playful mindset that treats tasks and interactions like games—full of curiosity, challenge, and fun.
Multi-sensory: Engaging multiple senses at once to create a richer, more immersive experience.
Improvisation: Creating and responding in the moment without a fixed plan, guided by intuition and adaptability.

## Embody (moodboard)

```txt
- Image 1:
  - title: Confetti burst
  - prompt: A candid street-level photo of a hand popping a biodegradable confetti cannon on a sunny sidewalk, with colorful paper pieces mid-air, surprised laughing faces in soft focus, and a bright high-saturation editorial style with crisp freeze-frame motion.
- Image 2:
  - title: Neon hopscotch
  - prompt: A dusk scene of a city plaza where glow-in-the-dark hopscotch lines and playful doodles are painted across the pavement, kids and adults mid-jump in energetic poses, captured in a cinematic wide-angle shot with vibrant neon accents and shallow depth of field.
- Image 3:
  - title: Jelly textures
  - prompt: A macro still-life of wobbly translucent jelly cubes in candy colors on a glossy plate with condensation beads, light refracting into prismatic highlights, photographed in a clean studio setup with playful pastel gradients and tactile realism.
- Image 4:
  - title: Mismatched socks
  - prompt: A cozy bedroom scene showing feet in brightly patterned mismatched socks kicking playfully off a rumpled duvet, scattered polaroids and stickers nearby, shot in warm natural window light with a whimsical lifestyle photography aesthetic.
- Image 5:
  - title: Bubble parade
  - prompt: A park walkway filled with oversized soap bubbles drifting through golden-hour light as someone runs with a giant bubble wand, bystanders reaching and laughing, rendered in dreamy high-key photography with iridescent reflections and gentle motion blur.

## Parameterize

```txt
- Cap interaction mechanism: Defines how the cap opens/closes and enables playful use, e.g., flip-top, pump, twist-off, squeeze-to-pop, or one-handed press-and-release.
- Bottle silhouette profile: Specifies the overall container shape language and ergonomics, e.g., rounded pebble, wavy/jelly-like form, hourglass grip, character-inspired outline, or tall cylindrical.
- Front-label graphic motif: Determines the primary visual pattern/illustration style used on-pack, e.g., confetti burst shapes, bubble/iridescent dots, neon doodle lines, mismatched pattern patches, or pastel gradient jelly textures.
- Surface finish treatment: Defines the tactile and visual finish of the bottle/label surfaces, e.g., soft-touch matte, high-gloss, satin, micro-embossed texture, prismatic/iridescent varnish accents, or spot UV.
- Color palette strategy: Specifies the packaging color system and intensity, e.g., pastel gradients, candy-bright high saturation, neon accent pops on a neutral base, warm golden tones, or limited two-color + highlight scheme.
- Acoustic experience: Defines the sounds the package makes during handling and use, e.g., quiet damped flip, crisp snap-close click, soft squeeze "whoosh," subtle rattle from internal bead, or near-silent pump stroke.

## Design

```txt
- Concept name: Bubble Parade Pop-Top
  - Cap interaction mechanism: One-handed press-and-release flip-top with a soft domed button; opens with a crisp snap-close click to feel like a tiny ‘pop’
  - Bottle silhouette profile: Rounded pebble with a gentle hourglass grip for wet hands; wide, stable base for bath ledges
  - Front-label graphic motif: Bubble/iridescent dots drifting upward with a few oversized ‘hero’ bubbles and subtle motion-blur arcs
  - Surface finish treatment: Soft-touch matte bottle + spot UV glossy bubbles + small prismatic/iridescent varnish hits inside select bubbles
  - Color palette strategy: Milky cloud-white base with pastel gradients (aqua→lavender→peach) and subtle pearlescent sheen
  - Acoustic experience: Crisp snap-close click on shut; near-silent open to avoid startling baby

- Concept name: Jelly Wiggle Squeeze-Whoosh
  - Cap interaction mechanism: Squeeze-to-pop push cap: pinch the sides to lift a short spout; closes by pressing down flat (safe, spill-resistant)
  - Bottle silhouette profile: Wavy/jelly-like form with soft ribs for tactile grip; slightly squishy wall for playful ‘wiggle’ feedback
  - Front-label graphic motif: Pastel gradient jelly textures with translucent cube shapes and condensation-like dot clusters
  - Surface finish treatment: High-gloss bottle with micro-embossed ‘dewdrop’ texture around grip zones; clear label with satin ink for the jelly cubes
  - Color palette strategy: Candy-pastel translucents (mint, strawberry, lemon) kept light and milky for baby-suitable softness
  - Acoustic experience: Soft squeeze “whoosh” as the cap pops open and the bottle compresses slightly

- Concept name: Neon Hopscotch Doodle Pump
  - Cap interaction mechanism: Short-stroke pump with twist-to-lock collar; pump head shaped like a rounded ‘hop’ pad for easy adult one-hand use
  - Bottle silhouette profile: Tall cylindrical with subtle side finger channels and a slightly tilted shoulder to suggest motion/jump
  - Front-label graphic motif: Neon doodle lines forming hopscotch steps, stars, and playful arrows; a small ‘path’ that wraps partially around the bottle
  - Surface finish treatment: Satin base label with spot UV on neon doodles; bottle in soft-touch matte for warm, secure handling
  - Color palette strategy: Clean warm neutral base (cream) with neon accent pops (electric aqua, pink, lime) used sparingly for baby-friendly playfulness
  - Acoustic experience: Quiet, damped pump stroke with a gentle end-of-stroke ‘thunk’ (no sharp click)
