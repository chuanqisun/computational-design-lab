Below is a TODO list for work in this repo. We need to address one item at a time, but items of the same category or have co-dependency can be addressed as a group.

When addressing the items, you must first update any relavent insturctions in .github/instructions/\*.instructions.md files.
When you are done addressing the item, you must move it from the `#TODO` list to the `#DONE` list below it.

# TODO

- Change the pin/reject workflow. When user click Generate Concepts/Artifacts/Design, do NOT move anything to the rejection list. Instead, just append below the existing list.
  - Move the Generate and Manual add buttons to the bottom of the list
  - Add another button that says "Pinned only" and removes unpinned items
- In the rejection list, when expanded, expose a Clear button "forgets" all rejected items

# DONE
